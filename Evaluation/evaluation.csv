What are the four megatrends in the world of learning?,"- The four megatrends in the world of learning are:
  1. From formal to informal learning
  2. From learning to support
  3. From knowledge to skills
  4. From top-down to bottom-up

- These trends have a significant impact on the learning and development landscape, influencing each other and forming the axes of the learning diagram.
- The learning diagram illustrates how corporate learning is evolving and adapting to these changes.
- Each trend plays a crucial role in shaping the way organizations approach learning and development, emphasizing the importance of adapting to new paradigms in L&D.","['COPYRIGHT MATERIAL\nNOT FOR REPRODUCTION1\nWhat is happening in the  \nworld of\xa0learning?\nMany things impact learning and development (L&D). The Covid-19 \npandemic, a changing workforce, new technologies and the ever-\nincreasing speed of business are just a few examples of these changes. \nTrends such as the skill gap, Big Data, the 70:20:10 model and artifi -\ncial intelligence (AI) emerge as hypes but eventually settle into a new \nnormal, leaving their mark on the L&D landscape. While many such \ntrends come and go, we’ve focused on more significant, enduring \nshifts – the megatrends. (Otherwise, this chapter alone would fill the \nwhole book.) We’ve distilled them down to four primary, long-term changes that L&D must navigate:\n1 From formal to informal learning.\n2 From learning to support.\n3 From knowledge to skills.\n4 From top-down to bottom-up.'

What are the common concerns associated with EGL?,"Common concerns associated with Employee-Generated Learning (EGL) in large enterprises include:

1. Disruption of the status quo:
   - EGL may introduce new approaches to content and knowledge management, leading to a change management effort.
   - Concerns may arise about how this disruption will impact existing processes and systems within the organization.

2. Advocacy and stakeholder support:
   - Continuous support and guidance from senior leaders are crucial for the success of EGL.
   - Constant communication between different stakeholders is necessary to ensure alignment and buy-in.
   - Publicizing success stories to emphasize the power of EGL can help address concerns and garner support.
   - Providing awareness training at all levels is essential to remind employees of the benefits of EGL.

3. Organizational size and complexity:
   - Implementing EGL in large organizations with complex structures and multiple departments may raise concerns about standardization and scalability.
   - Tailoring standardized frameworks and procedures to various departments or regions may pose challenges.

4. Budget and resource availability:
   - Adequate resources, including budget, dedicated staff, and sophisticated technology, are vital for scaling EGL in large enterprises.
   - Concerns may arise about the initial investment required for EGL and the potential return on investment (ROI) it can deliver.

5. Evaluation of EGL:
   - Stakeholders may question the value and effectiveness of EGL, necessitating a thorough evaluation process.
   - Analyzing both tangible (quantifiable) and intangible (non-quantifiable) benefits is essential for assessing the impact of EGL.
   - Quantifying the impact through ROI calculations can be complex and requires a deep understanding of costs associated with EGL, including L&D efforts, investment in tools, and time devoted by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).","['COPYRIGHT MATERIAL\nNOT FOR REPRODUCTION\nEMPLOYEE-GENERATED LEARNING FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES155\nway, the EGL initiative will be perceived as something that comple-\nments other initiatives rather than a standalone investment.

Share some examples of how other companies have successfully implemented EGL?,"- In small and medium enterprises, successful implementations of Employee-Generated Learning (EGL) have been achieved through the following methods:
  1. Adopting a phased approach to EGL implementation, targeting different departments or business units with tailored EGL initiatives.
  2. Showcasing successful EGL case studies in various departments to inspire others to participate.
  3. Collecting feedback from supervisors or team leaders to assess the applicability of EGL content for employees' specific roles in day-to-day tasks.
  4. Encouraging employees to share real-life examples where EGL content helped them in problem-solving or decision-making.
  5. Making a decision on fully adopting EGL after the pilot phase, with many smaller organizations opting for a more democratized approach.
  6. Completing the pilot phase relatively quickly in small and medium-sized firms due to flat organizational structures and quick decision-making.
  7. Publicizing EGL initiatives to ensure awareness and organic growth within the organization.

- In large enterprises with abundant resources and a global presence, successful implementation of EGL requires a more formal approach, considering the following factors:
  1. Organizational size and complexity: Developing standardized frameworks and procedures tailored to various departments or regions within the vast organization.
  2. Budget and resource availability: Having adequate resources, including budget, dedicated staff, and sophisticated technology, is crucial for successful scaling of EGL in large firms.
  3.

"Isn't this too much expectation from the SME to take on this extra workload of now creating courses as well, while still taking care of their work and KPIs. like why would they do it? What is the incentive for them?","- The incentive for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to take on the extra workload of creating courses includes:
  - Recognition and praise from colleagues, boosting their reputation as an expert, which serves as a motivational factor.
  - Opportunity to discuss their topic with upper management, leading to impactful acknowledgments of their efforts.
  - The history of education where they were given lots of material to study, even if not directly related to their job, might influence their behavior.
  - Lack of credit for their efforts is a significant concern for SMEs, leading to reluctance in knowledge sharing.
  - Absence of incentives or rewards for sharing knowledge can also be a demotivating factor for SMEs.
  - Time availability for non-priority initiatives and uncertainty about the value of their content are additional concerns that may deter SMEs from taking on the responsibility of creating courses.
  - Concerns about their expertise being diminished if everyone has access to their knowledge can also impact their willingness to share knowledge.
- Possible solutions to incentivize SMEs to create courses and engage in knowledge sharing include:
  - Encouraging the use of techniques like goals-questions-content or do-know framework to structure and steer thoughts towards actionable content.
  - Encouraging SMEs to create performance support content instead of full-fledged courses.
  - Providing training to SMEs on creating better learning content, as it's more effective than correcting each course individually.
  - Offering example courses or templates to facilitate the course creation process for SMEs.","['COPYRIGHT MATERIAL\nNOT FOR REPRODUCTION\nPOTENTIAL PITFALLS AND OBJECTIONS97\njob aid, praise from their colleagues boosts their reputation as an \nexpert.
